# Stochastic Simulation


### Github organization
For the final work of `MATH-414`, we picked the project: [Stochastic approximation in mathematical finance](Docs/stochastic_approximation.pdf). We were asked to answer the questions and deliver a report accompanied by an oral presentation.

In the [Source](Source) folder, you can find the [Jupyter Notebook](Source/Project.qmd) as well as two module .py files [European functions](Source/European_Functions.py) and [Asian functions](Source/Asian_Functions.py). And you can find the final report and the presentation [here](Docs/Project.pdf) and [here](Docs/Presentation.pdf).
